# S-FAR
Program code of  regularization  and techniques: Including the S-FAR Methods, Debiasing Technique, and Thresholding Technique

"There are three folders in <S-FAS_debiase_threshold.zip>: the <compare_with_CG> folder, the <debiasing> folder, and the <thresholding> folder."


There are programs for the S-FAR method with \theta =0.9, 1.5, 1.99,  Landweber method and the CG method. We provide a 1-dimensional example (see Example 1(2) in our paper) and a 2-dimensional example (see Example 3(2) in our paper).

Please run <generate_noise.m> first, then <test_many.m>, and finally <plt.m>.

Please run <generate_noise.m> first, then <test_many.m>, and finally <plt.m> for any example."

First, ensure that the data from folder1 is successfully imported using data.m, then run code1.m, followed by code2.m.
